# Billboard 100 to Spotify Playlist Automator

This Python app automates the creation of a Spotify playlist using songs from the Billboard Hot 100 chart for any date you choose.

## What This Automated App Does

- Prompts you to enter a date (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Web-scrapes the Billboard Hot 100 chart for that date
- Searches Spotify for each song
- Creates a new Spotify playlist
- Adds the found songs to the playlist

All runs automatically and all you have to do is run the script and tell it **which year you want to music-travel back to**
